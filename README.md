Determining Nafion relative solvent-water uptakes through Linear regression models, previously trained with solvent-saturated and water-saturated Nafion ATR-FTIR Spectra 

Uploaded in this files are 3 examples for determining Nafion relative water/solvent uptake, as Jupyter Notebooks:
- Ethanol in Nafion
- Water in Nafion
- Ethanol and Water in Nafion

Also uploaded are three pickle files with dictionaries of experimental data, containing the FTIR spectra of Nafion exposed to different atmospheric saturations of selected solvents
